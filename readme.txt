Master PDF Viewer 

== Description ==
Upload PDF files and then immediately embed them into the posts and pages on your website. As easy to use as adding photographs! Your PDF files will automatically resize to their proper dimensions. Additionally, if you indicate a width, the proper height will be determined automatically. The embedded PDF will display flawlessly on any device thanks to the responsive design of our Master PDF Viewer plugin.

The plugin uses only Javascript in a special way to embed PDF files. This gives you a ton of choice when it comes to how your document will look.


If some parts of a PDF file are too small for your screen, you can zoom in and out using the Next and Previous buttons on the PDF viewer.

All Javascript and other files are supplied by your own server, and your PDF files are embedded within your already-existing WordPress sites so that we have complete control over appearance (not by Google or any other third-party who may not be able to guarantee their own reliability). This implies that there will be no speed degradation when loading your PDF files.

= Usage =

1. Once installed and Activated, click Add new block from any page or post, just like adding an image, but drag and drop a PDF file instead.

2. When you insert into your post, it will appear in the editor as a 'Gutenberg Block' as follows:

3. You can change the default appearance - e.g. width, and toolbar position/appearance through **Settings -> PDF Viewer**.

== Installation ==

Easiest way:

1. Go to your WordPress admin control panel's plugin page
1. Search for 'Master PDF Viewer'
1. Click Install
1. Click Activate on the plugin

If you cannot install from the WordPress plugins directory for any reason, and need to install from ZIP file:

1. Upload directory and contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or upload the ZIP file directly in
the Plugins section of your Wordpress admin
1. Follow the instructions from step 4 above


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I obtain support for this product? =

We may occasionally be able to respond to support queries posted on the 'Support' forum here on the wordpress.org plugin page, but we recommend sending us an email instead if possible.

= How can I change the Size or customize the Toolbar? =

See Settings -> Master PDF Viewer in your WordPress admin to change site-wide defaults. You can also override individual embeds by modifying the Gutenberg Block.


= Can I improve the viewing experience for mobile users? =

Yes, our plugin has an intelligent 'full screen' mode.
When the document is smaller than a certain width, the document displays only as a 'thumbnail' with a large 'View in Full Screen' button for the user to click when they want to study your document.
This opens up the document so it has the full focus of the mobile browser, and the user can move about the document without hitting other parts of the web page by mistake.
Click Exit to return to the regular web page.


= Can I protect my PDFs so they are difficult for viewers to download directly? =

Yes - it is relatively easy to find the link to download the file directly.
